**Fine-tune LLaVA on Custom Datasets Using NVIDIA Brev**

NVIDIA Brev is a super useful resource for those of us who train large AI models and need access to powerful GPUs. 
Brev allows you to connect to a variety of cloud GPUs from your own computer.
They have some coding tutorials on what can be done by connecting to these GPUs, however, these tutorials are not regularly updated.
I began working on their LLaVA fine-tuning tutorial on YouTube and unfortunately ran into many problems and errors along the way because of dependency issues, GPU memory issues, and more.

This repo will show you how you can successfully fine-tune LLaVA on a custom dataset using Brev.
